# London_ward_for_living
The project is about using data visualisation to help new comers in London find a suitable place to live. In order to do it, I built a dashboard in Tableau with the public datasets found online.
The final product is a dashboard includes ward map/tube station/crime rate/ethnic groups/employment/income information for all the wards, with panels on the right to allow customer settings/filterings.
Original data about employment, house price and etc. were stored in ward-atlas-data file. In order to incorperate the geographic and public transportation information in the visualisation, I put a map in the dashboard. In order to build the map, I found a dataset containing the geographic information about different wards in London, and combined with the tube station dataset with the variable "postcode" by a simple python script.
The workbook has been published onto the Tableau community, which could be viewed and downloaded via this link: https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/t/faynasdatavis/views/Londonwardsforliving/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:showShareOptions=true&:display_count=no&:showVizHome=no.
